# 42_Push_swap
This project will sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.
 
 ## Instructions
 There are only 2 stacks and the allowed movements are:
 * **SWAP** Swap the first 2 elements at the top of the stack.
 * **PUSH** Take the first element at the top of the stack and put it at the top of the other stack.
 * **ROTATE** Shift up all elements of the stack by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
 * **REVERSE ROTATE** Shift down all elements of the stack by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
 
 
### ✨Personal learning✨
* Manipulation of double linked lists.
* Error control of arguments.
* Sorting algorithms.
